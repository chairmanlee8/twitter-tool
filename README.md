# TODO

- solve the color issue
- i command for inspect (print raw json tweet to log mode); Esc to return to alt mode
- maybe solve double-buffering to fix flashing on full re-render
- show timestamp (simple format for now, drop year for brevity)
- side pane with full tweet expansion (incl. multiline)
- for displaying tweets, prefix char (highlight for select, _^=reply, RT=retweet, QT=quote tweet)
- space to expand reply, RT, QT inline
