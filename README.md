# TODO

- figure out how to highlight only accounts w/ notifs on (or seed such a list)
- word truncation on tweets pane, plus triple dot
- show threads as [n]
- consider moving to GUI already? or maybe see how far unicode gfx can go
- page up/page down tweets
- index tweets? for vim style jump
- priority accounts (highlight, show condensed listing)
- adjust timestamps to local tz
- expand images/replies/QTs/related tweets
- maybe solve double-buffering to fix flashing on full re-render
- side pane with full tweet expansion (incl. multiline)
- for displaying tweets, prefix char (highlight for select, _^=reply, RT=retweet, QT=quote tweet)
- space to expand reply, RT, QT inline
- use anyhow for error results
